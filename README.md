# US_Medical_Insurance_Costs Data Analysis
Given a medical insurance costs dataset as a .csv file, I determined what questions I wanted to answer and how to use Python to answer those questions.
Based on the provided data, I decided to examine differences in average insurance costs based on sex and region in which the individual lives.

## Project Objectives
- My first portfolio project of the Codecademy Data Analyst Career Path.  
- The purpose of the assignment is to investigate a medical insurance costs dataset in a .csv file using the Python skills that were recently developed.
- This is the first assignment that did not include step-by-step directions on how to conduct the analyses, and it was up to me to determine which analyses 
to run based on the data provided in the dataset.  


## Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
